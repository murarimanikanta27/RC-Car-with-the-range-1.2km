# RC Car with NRF24L01 Module

## Overview

This project involves building a remote-controlled (RC) car using the NRF24L01 module for wireless communication. The car is controlled by an Arduino-based transmitter that sends commands to a receiver mounted on the car. The receiver processes these commands to control the car's motors, allowing it to move forward, backward, and turn left or right.

## Features

- **Wireless Control**: The NRF24L01 module provides reliable wireless communication between the transmitter and the receiver.
- **Arduino-Based**: Both the transmitter and receiver use Arduino microcontrollers, making the system easy to program and customize.
- **DC Motor Control**: The receiver controls the DC motors on the car, allowing for precise movement and direction changes.
- **Customizable Control Inputs**: The transmitter can be equipped with various control inputs, such as joysticks or potentiometers, for flexible operation.

## Components

### Transmitter

- **Arduino Uno or Nano**: The microcontroller that reads the input from the controls and sends commands to the receiver.
- **NRF24L01 Module**: Handles wireless communication with the receiver.
- **Control Inputs**: Could include a joystick, potentiometer, buttons, or switches to control the car's movements.
- **Power Supply**: Battery pack to power the transmitter setup.

### Receiver

- **Arduino Uno or Nano**: The microcontroller that receives commands from the transmitter and controls the car's motors.
- **NRF24L01 Module**: Receives wireless data from the transmitter.
- **Motor Driver (e.g., L298N)**: Controls the speed and direction of the DC motors.
- **DC Motors**: Drive the wheels of the car.
- **Power Supply**: Battery pack to power the receiver and motors.

## Wiring Diagram

### Transmitter

1. **NRF24L01 Module**:
   - VCC to 3.3V on Arduino
   - GND to GND on Arduino
   - CE to digital pin 9
   - CSN to digital pin 10
   - SCK to digital pin 13
   - MOSI to digital pin 11
   - MISO to digital pin 12

2. **Control Inputs**:
   - Connect joystick or potentiometer outputs to analog pins on the Arduino (e.g., A0, A1).
   - Connect buttons or switches to digital pins.

3. **Power Supply**:
   - Connect a battery pack to power the Arduino and NRF24L01 module.

### Receiver

1. **NRF24L01 Module**: Same wiring as the transmitter.

2. **Motor Driver (L298N)**:
   - IN1, IN2, IN3, IN4 to Arduino digital pins (e.g., D4, D5, D6, D7).
   - ENA and ENB (enable pins) to PWM-capable pins on the Arduino (e.g., D3, D11).
   - Motor outputs to the DC motors.
   - Power inputs to the battery pack.

3. **DC Motors**:
   - Connect the motors to the output terminals of the motor driver.

4. **Power Supply**:
   - Connect a battery pack to power the Arduino, motor driver, and motors.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rc-car-nrf24l01.git
   cd rc-car-nrf24l01
   ```

2. **Upload the Code**:
   - Open the Arduino IDE.
   - Open the `transmitter.ino` file for the transmitter setup.
   - Open the `receiver.ino` file for the receiver setup.
   - Connect each Arduino to your computer via USB.
   - Select the correct board and port from the Arduino IDE.
   - Click Upload to flash the code to each Arduino.

3. **Assemble the Car**:
   - Attach the Arduino, NRF24L01 module, motor driver, and motors to the car chassis.
   - Double-check all wiring connections according to the diagrams.

4. **Power On**:
   - Insert batteries into the transmitter and receiver.
   - Turn on the transmitter and receiver.
   - Use the controls on the transmitter to drive the car.

## How It Works

1. **Wireless Communication**: The transmitter sends control signals via the NRF24L01 module to the receiver on the car.
2. **Motor Control**: The receiver processes these signals and controls the motor driver to move the car in the desired direction.
3. **Responsive Driving**: The setup allows for real-time control of the car's movements, providing a smooth and responsive driving experience.

## Troubleshooting

- **No Response from Car**: Check that both NRF24L01 modules are correctly powered and that they are within range. Ensure that the CE and CSN pins are correctly configured in the code.
- **Motors Not Moving Correctly**: Verify the wiring between the motor driver and motors, and ensure that the motor driver is receiving power.
- **Interference Issues**: If the communication is unstable, try changing the communication channel or reducing the transmission speed in the code.
